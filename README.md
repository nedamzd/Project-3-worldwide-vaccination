# worldwide-vaccination


In this dashboard we hope to present trends for the 2020-2021 data regarding COVID vaccinations, cases, deaths, and much more. Our rationale for this dashboard was to make relevant the circumstances from country to country and to allow the viewer to educate themselves on the effects of COVID-19 worldwide. Our dashboard would be useful for travelers or those interested in researching the COVID-19 pandemic and its trends.
